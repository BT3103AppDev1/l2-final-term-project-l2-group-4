## Executive Summary
Tracking and accessing personal investments poses a challenge for Singaporean investors, who often spread their portfolios across multiple platforms and asset classes. As a centralised platform for tracking stocks, bonds, Central Provident Fund (CPF) and cash holdings in real-time, our web app simplifies the investment process. 

With compiled financial information across multiple trading platforms and various asset classes, this enables comprehensive portfolio management and instant access to asset valuations. The app distinguishes itself through analytical visualisations, along with its intuitive features to quickly edit investment information, providing deep insights into performance analysis and asset allocation, all tailored to the unique needs of Singaporean investors. 

Our app addresses the growing demand for efficient investment strategies with a focus on user experience and holistic portfolio oversight. By incorporating CPF and cash holdings alongside traditional investments, our solution offers unparalleled convenience and insight, positioning it as a preferred choice for investors aiming to optimise their financial portfolios.
